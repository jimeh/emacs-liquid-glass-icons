# EmacsLG Sources

This directory contains source files used to create layer SVGs used in Icon
Composer.

The Adobe Illustrator files are Apple's "App Icon Template" for Illustrator
available from Apple's [Design Resources][ds] page.

[ds]: https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/

Each Illustrator file has relevant shapes borrowed from the [emacs.svg][] file
in Emacs' sources.

The individual layers were exported from Illustrator using the "Export for Icon
Composer" script included with Apple's App Icon Template for Illustrator.
